The solution is

xmodmap -e "keycode 115 = Pointer_Button2"
Now my Home key is doing left click and behaves just as if I hit the mouse click and I can keep the key pressed and it highlights (copies) as expected.

I also mapped my End key to be middle click, so I can use it to paste:

xmodmap -e "keycode 110 = Pointer_Button1"
Note that it is necessary to have "mousekeys" (mouse emulation using the numeric keypad) enabled for this to work. "mousekeys" can be toggled by pressing Shift+NumLock or set explicitly by running:

dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/a11y/keyboard/mousekeys-enable true
dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/a11y/keyboard/mousekeys-enable false
